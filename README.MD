# Object Detection Mobile App with YOLOv8 & Kivy

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to build a mobile application for object detection using the Kivy framework and YOLOv8. The application utilizes a pre-trained pytoch model to perform object detection on an image captured by the device camera.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Kivy
- pytoch
- asone



## Running the Application
We can run the object detection application using the following command:

`
$ python search_v2.py
`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the simplicity and ease of building a mobile object detection application using the Kivy framework and YOLOv8. The application can be easily customized and expanded to perform more advanced tasks.
